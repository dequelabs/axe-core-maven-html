## Philosophy

We believe that automated testing has an important role to play in achieving digital equality and that in order to do that, it must achieve mainstream adoption by professional web developers. That means that the tests must inspire trust, must be fast, must work everywhere and must be available everywhere.

## Manifesto

1. Automated accessibility testing rules must have a zero false positive rate
2. Automated accessibility testing rules must be lightweight and fast
3. Automated accessibility testing rules must work in all modern browsers
4. Automated accessibility testing rules must, themselves, be tested automatically
