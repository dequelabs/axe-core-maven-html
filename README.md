# aXe Selenium (Java) Integration

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/dequelabs/axe-selenium-java.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/dequelabs/axe-selenium-java)

This example demonstrates how to use aXe to run web accessibility tests in Java
projects with the Selenium browser automation tool and Java development tools.

Selenium integration enables testing of full pages and sites.

## Requirements ##

* Chrome must be installed; follow the directions at https://www.google.com/chrome/ to
  install it.  On Unix, ensure that Chrome is on your path.
* Chrome Driver must be installed; follow the directions at: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/getting-started to install it.
* The Java SE Development Kit must be installed; follow the directions at
  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html to install
  it.
* Maven must be installed; follow the directions at http://maven.apache.org/ to
  install it. Ensure that it is on your path.

## To run the example ##

1. Move to the `selenium-java` directory.
2. Ensure that `axe.min.js` is located in `/src/test/resources`.
3. `node src/test/resources/test-app.js` to start the fixture server.
4. `mvn test` to build and run the JUnit tests that drive Selenium against the fixture.

This should launch an automated Firefox window, load and analyze the
configured web pages, and then pass/fail a JUnit test depending on whether
there are any accessibility violations detected.

## To modify the example ##

To run the example tests on your own web page, change the URL passed to
`driver.get` in `ExampleTest.setUp()`.

## To use the AXE helper library in your own tests ##

Include this library as a test-scoped dependency in your POM:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.deque</groupId>
        <artifactId>axe-selenium</artifactId>
        <version>2.0</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>

`axe.js` or `axe.min.js` must be available to your test fixtures as a
`java.net.URL`. The simplest way to do this is to include it in your own
`src.test.resources` and pass `MyTest.class.getResource("/axe.min.js")` to the
`Builder` constructor as demonstrated in the `ExampleTest`.

The `AXE` helper defines three public methods and a nested `Builder` class for
your unit tests.

* `inject` will inject the required script into the page under test and any
iframes.  This only needs to be run against a given page once, and `Builder`
will take care of it for you if you use that.
* `report` will pretty-print a list of violations.
* `writeResults` will write the JSON violations list out to a file with the
specified name in the current working directory.

The `Builder` class allows tests to chain configuration and analyze pages. The
constructor takes in a `WebDriver` that has already navigated to the page under
test and a `java.net.URL` pointing to the aXe script; from there, you can set
`options()`, `include()` and `exclude()` selectors, `skipFrames()`, and finally,
`analyze()` the page.

* `options` wires a JSON string to aXe, allowing rules to be toggled on
or off. See the `testAccessibilityWithOptions` unit test for a sample
single-rule execution, and the [axe-core API documentation](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/master/doc/API.md#b-options-parameter)
for full documentation on the options object. The runOnly option with tags
may be of particular interest, allowing aXe to execute all rules with the
specified tag(s).
* `include` adds to the list of included selectors. If you do not call
`include` at all, aXe will run against the entire document.
* `exclude` adds to the list of excluded selectors. Exclusions allow you to
focus scope exactly where you need it, ignoring child elements you don't want
to test.
* `skipFrames` prevents aXe to be recursively injected into all iframes.
* `analyze` executes aXe with any configuration you have previously
defined. If you want to test a single `WebElement`, you may pass it into
`analyze` instead of using `include` and `exclude`.

The aXe documentation should be consulted for more details on customizing and
analyzing calls to `axe.run`.
